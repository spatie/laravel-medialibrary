This package can associate all sorts of files with Eloquent models. It provides a
simple API to work with. To learn all about it, head over to [the extensive documentation](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary).

Here are a few short examples of what you can do:

```php
$newsItem = News::find(1);
$newsItem->addMedia($pathToFile)->toMediaCollection('images');
```

It can handle your uploads directly:

```php
$newsItem->addMedia($request->file('image'))->toMediaCollection('images');
```

Want to store some large files on another filesystem? No problem:

```php
$newsItem->addMedia($smallFile)->toMediaCollection('downloads', 'local');
$newsItem->addMedia($bigFile)->toMediaCollection('downloads', 's3');
```

The storage of the files is handled by [Laravel's Filesystem](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem),
so you can use any filesystem you like. Additionally, the package can create image manipulations
on images and pdfs that have been added in the media library.
