title: About us
---

[Spatie](https://spatie.be) is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium.

Open source software is used in all projects we deliver. Laravel, Nginx, Ubuntu are just a few 
of the free pieces of software we use every single day. For this, we are very grateful. 
When we feel we have solved a problem in a way that can help other developers, 
we release our code as open source software [on GitHub](https://spatie.be/opensource).

This medialibrary package was made and is maintained by [Sebastian De Deyne](https://twitter.com/sebdedeyne) 
and [Freek Van der Herten](https://twitter.com/freekmurze). There are 
[many other contributors](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary/graphs/contributors) as well.
